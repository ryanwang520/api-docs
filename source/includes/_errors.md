# Errors

ArcSite uses HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of a request. Codes within the 2xx range are considered as successfully completed transactions. Codes within the 4xx and 5xx ranges will indicate that a failure has occurred.

We use the following error codes to manage common failures.

The ArcSite API uses the following error codes:
