Welcome to the ArcSite API ðŸ‘‹

The ArcSite API is organized around [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer). Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts [JSON-encoded](http://www.json.org/) request bodies, returns [JSON-encoded](http://www.json.org/) responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.
